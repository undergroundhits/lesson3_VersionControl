            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control System is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 
Version Control also makes it possible for teams of developer's to work simultaneously on the same project while maintaining all areas of the project. 
Web Developers, Graphic Designers, and Web Designers often want to keep various copies of images, applications, or websites threw out the development cycle. 
If needed the data can be reverted back to its previous state or the entire project. Version Control give both the Author and those deployed to develop a app 
or image or web page the ability to restore a file to it previous state. From beginning to end so the changes made to any data within the version control system 
can be retrieved and applied without negatively affecting other teams working on the same area. The ability of version control can compare changes over time, see 
who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a Version Control System gives developers a hidden 
advantage because if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover the lost or messed up file. Their are many types of version control systems on the 
market among the most popular are svn, git, mercurial, cvs, and perforce. Developers have access to many forms of Version Control granted by the multitudes of software 
available. I will discuss the version associated to this class room assignment and the various benefits associated to its use later as one of my five concepts. The goal 
I want to accomplish for the reader is the understanding of what version control is and why it plays pivotal role in the development cycle. Version Control is for documents 
that undergo a lot of revision and redrafting and is particularly important for electronic documents because they can easily be changed by a number of different users. These 
changes may not be immediately apparent but may have a impact the project in a positive or adverse way and need to be resolved without having to starting from scratch.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is an open source software project that began in 1991 - 2002, changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. In 2005 the relationship between the two entities would break down cause the software free of charge status to be revoked. The Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) saw this as a opportunity to develop their own tool. The area they want to focus in where in the realm of Speed, Simple design, Strong support for non-linear development, Fully distributed, and Able to handle large projects. The tool created for te job "GIT". Since its introduction GIT has emerged as one of the most popular version control software's on the market is ranked seconded to SYN. Yet the critical issues that affect most other VERSION Control Systems GIT has solved the problem making it a favorite on the WEB DEVEOLPMENT COMMUNITY. GIT Is very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development and is very fast. Distribute model is another benefit of GIT in which access may be granted to certain file or a certain file is public while others are not. Branching and merging are made easy with GIT so that you can branch whenever you want. GIT has the qualities that allow to choose your own workflow. It can be as simple as a centralized workflow to as hierarchical as the dictator-lieutenant workflow. GIT also guarantees data integrity because it uses SHA1 trees, data corruption. One of the most important benefits of GIT is this the users is able to perform all operation from their local repository and commitchanges made to the central repository. Meaning the users are pulling information from their local repository making such information as the history or changes to a document or data available instantly. The major difference between Git and any other Version Control Systems is the way Git thinks about its data. Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store 
the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged which will be discussed later in this assignment. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commit</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The GIT Commit command is one of two commands that can record versions of a project into the repository’s history. The Git Commit statement is a method used in git to save data. Traditional file saving is method used to 
overwrite an existing file or write a new file. Git committing is an operation that acts upon a collection of files and directories. GIT Commits can be stored locally and tranfered or push to a remote sever by using the Push 
command which will discussed later. GIT commit differs from the typical method of file saving because to save and item two steps must be completed before the data is committed (saved)or is saved in the central repository. 
The steps are listed as following, first the user must edit a file to Commit, remember stated in the previous topic GIT will only save a file or make a snapshot if the file changed so if file has changed no commit is needed. Once
the file editing is complete the fill will need to moved to the staging area which will dicuss further in the next section. Staging a file in Git’s terminology means adding it to the staging area, in preparation for a commit.
If the changes or to your liking from here you can commit those changes to the repository by "PUSHING" them. Making the Commit command a very important components to the git software usage because users have to complete the steps
to achieve the result of a save record or file.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Staging is the GIT process before changes or revision are Committed to the remote or central repository. Because of the Process of saving a record or file to the central or remote repository a files must be staged in order to be Committed 
(saved). Git, with its index allows you to commit only certain parts of the changes you've done since the last commit. The Staging process is a very interesting in that once can submit parts of a completed projects in components. For example if
a developer was working part A, Part B, and Part C and after working on those parts was satisfied with only Part A and Part D, yet not completed with Part B. Parts A and Part D can be committed to the remote repository. This is a huge advantage in the realm
of web development and design. Because teams can submit components of a project as they are completed while other components may be still under development or testing. As long as a document or file is in the staging area, GIT allows you to edit it as you
like or replace staged files with other versions of staged files etc. Once in the staging area the document or file is ready to be committed but the developer still has the flexible to mitigate changes and updates prior to the GIT Commit.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git Push is used to submit commits made on your local branch to a remote repository. Once you have a project you want to commit the file or project will need to be pushed. This is done by using the following Git Command git push <remote> <branch>. You can also push a branch by using this Git command ($ git push origin master). This command however works only if you have cloned from a sever in which you have access rights. The Push commands can only used after staging  is complete and information is ready to saved to a repository.</p>
